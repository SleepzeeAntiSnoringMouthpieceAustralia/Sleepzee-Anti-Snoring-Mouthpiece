## What is the Sleepzee Anti Snoring Mouthpiece?

The Sleepzee Anti Snoring Mouthpiece is an oral device designed to combat snoring by repositioning the lower jaw and tongue. By doing so, it keeps the airway unobstructed, reducing vibrations in the throat that cause snoring.
It is a mandibular advancement device (MAD), one of the most widely recommended non-invasive methods for treating mild to moderate snoring and even mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Unlike bulky machines or invasive surgeries, this mouthpiece offers a simple, affordable, and comfortable solution that can be used daily.


## Why Snoring Happens

To understand how Sleepzee helps, it‚Äôs essential to know why people snore. Snoring occurs when the muscles of the throat relax during sleep, causing the airway to narrow. Sleepzee Anti Snoring Mouthpiece Australia As air passes through this narrowed passage, tissues in the throat vibrate, creating the familiar snoring sound.
Common causes of snoring include:
‚Ä¢	Obstructed nasal airways (due to allergies, cold, or sinus issues)
‚Ä¢	Relaxed throat muscles from alcohol consumption or sedatives
‚Ä¢	Being overweight, which increases tissue around the airway
‚Ä¢	Sleep position (sleeping on the back worsens snoring)
‚Ä¢	Aging, which reduces muscle tone in the throat
Sleepzee addresses the root cause of snoring by keeping the airway open.


## How Does Sleepzee Anti Snoring Mouthpiece Work?

The Sleepzee Mouthpiece uses mandibular advancement technology. Here‚Äôs how it works:
1.	Jaw Repositioning
The device gently moves the lower jaw forward. This prevents the tongue and soft tissues from collapsing backward into the airway.

By holding the airway open, airflow becomes smoother and uninterrupted. This eliminates the vibrations that produce snoring.
3.	Breathing Support
Users can breathe through both the nose and mouth while using the device, ensuring comfort.

Sleepzee is moldable using the ‚Äúboil and bite‚Äù method, which allows you to shape it to your teeth for a snug and secure fit.
This makes Sleepzee an effective, drug-free, and non-invasive solution to snoring.
